# Final Project

For the final project, you will develop a program that solves an applied linguistics problem of your choice.
Working on the final project might require you to read book chapters beyond the ones we cover in class.

## Projects from previous years:

**Adaptive vocabulary size test.** ALT students developed a program that delivers an adaptive computer-assisted
test of vocabulary size. They used the COCA list of top 5000 words, a list of pseudo-words, and a binary search
algorithm (similar to the one implemented in Small Project A).

**Dialog system for assessment purposes.** A spoken (or chat-based) dialog system that carries out a scripted dialog with the user to elicit scorable discourse.

**Splitting a text.** In a 591B class, students developed programs that will read in a single file containing multiple texts, and then split the texts into separate files.

**Working with tagged texts.** In a 591B class, students developed programs that process a corpus of tagged texts to obtain normalized rates of occurrence of linguistic feature for each text. This file then could be opened in Excel, SPSS or R for further statistical analyses.

## Grading (30 points total)

### Short paper (10 points)

In this paper, you should follow the APA style and should not exceed 1,500 words (excluding references). The paper should follow the structure of an introduction section of a research article (cf. CARS model). You should present a clear argument for (a) the importance of the issue you are solving with your program, and (b) the necessity of computer programming for addressing the issue at hand.

Evaluation criterea for the write-up: a convincing argument is made as detailed above; the writing is clearly organized, coherent, accurate, and effective in achieving the stated purposes; the paper is formatted appropriately.

This paper will have three required versions:

- 250-word proposal. This is simply the idea along with what will be done. It will be graded on
completeness only. The instructor and one or more classmates will provide feedback on the
proposal. If a student changes topics after the proposal stage, permission must be granted by the
instructor. (1 point)
- Completed draft of paper. This submission is also graded on completeness only. Students will
receive feedback from a peer. (2 points)
- Final version of paper. This version is graded based on the evaluation criteria above. (7 points)

### The program and documentation (10 points)

The program should be submitted on GitHib in a folder named "final". The folder should include any files necessary for a user to run your program, and any user documentation (readme.txt) that is necessary. The documentation should discuss any and all major limitations of your program that the user should know.

- Your program is syntactically correct: 2 points.
- Your program has the necessary user documentation: 2 points.
- Your program works correctly per the description: 3 points.
- Your program does not have major undocumented limitations: 3 points.

The final version of your program is due on Friday of finals week.

### Oral presentation (10 points)

You will give a 12-minute presentation of your project. The number of slides should be limited to six or less, and the presentation should be organized as follows:

- Introduction and general information (one slide - about a minute)
- Justification of the importance of the task (one slide - about a minute)
- Description of data structures, algorithms, programming and debugging methods that you used (2-4 slides - 4-5 minutes)
- Limitations of your program (one slide - about a minute)
- Demonstration of your program (3-4 minutes)

Evaluation criteria for the presentation: In addition to the effectiveness of the presentation in each
of the above categories, the presentation will be assessed based on effectiveness of delivery, that is,
preparation and audience engagement. As might be expected at a professional presentation, the presenter should talk with minimal use of notes.
