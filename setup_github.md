# Set up GitHub

## Follow the instructions below.

Step 1. Register for a free GitHub account
- Go to github.com
- Under "Sign up", you are asked to pick a username. Select a username by which you would be known on the GitHub site. (If possible and to avoid confusion, you may want to select a username identical or similar to your ISU net-id.)
- On the "Welcome to GitHub" screen, choose the "Free" plan ($0), click "Continue".
- You may skip the "Tailor your experience" step.
- You will need to verify your email address. Please check your CyMail and click on the link in a verification email from GitHub. Note that because of the way ISU's spam filtering mechanism works, it may take up to 15 minutes for the email to arrive.
- Once your email address is verified, you will be taken to the main page of your GitHub account.

Step 2. Create a new repository
- Click "New repository" on the left.
- Under "Repository name", enter "320" (without quotes). This will be the name of your repository.
- Leave all other options as default.
- Click "Create repository"
- You will now be taken to the main page your new GitHub repository. Find the line that says "Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file". Click on "creating a new file".
- Under "Name your file", enter "index.html" (without quotes)
- In the text editor under "Edit new file", enter "Hello, world!" (without quotes)
- Scroll down to the bottom and click the green button "Commit new file"
- Click the "Settings" tab at the top
- Scroll down to "GitHub pages"
- Under "Source", select "master branch"
- Click "Save"

Step 3. Check if you've done everything correctly
- Wait for a couple of minutes to make sure all changes are applied, then go to:
https://yourusername.github.io/516/
(replace yourusername with the username you selecte in step 1)
- If you see "Hello, world!", congratulations! You have successfully completed this step.

Step 4. Download and install a text editor
- If you use Windows, download and install the text editor “Notepad++” from https://notepad-plus-plus.org/
- If you use a Mac, install the app "TextWrangler" from the Apple AppStore

Step 5. Install the desktop client
- Go to https://desktop.github.com/
- Download the GitHub desktop for your platform
- Log in with your email and password that you've set up above
- Click "Clone a repository"
- Under "GitHub.com", select your repository: iastate-netid/320
- Once the repository is cloned, click "Fetch origin" at the top
- Click “Repository”, then “Show in Explorer” (on Windows) or “Show in Finder” (on Mac). A folder named “320” with your “index.html” file will open.
- Double-click the “index.html” file to verify that it opens in your browser and displays the “Hello, world!” message.
- On Windows, right-click the “index.html” file and click “Edit with Notepad++”. On Mac, select “File”, then “Open with”, then “TextWrangler”.
- On either system, the file will open in a text editor. Add a second line to the file saying “This is a test” (without quotes). Save the file.
- Go back to the “GitHub Desktop” window. It should show you the change that you’ve made to the file. Click “Commit to master”, the “Push origin”.
- Wait for a couple of minutes to make sure all changes are applied, then go to: https://yourusername.github.io/516/ (replace yourusername with the username you selecte in step 1)
- If you see "Hello, world! This is a test", congratulations! You have successfully completed this homework assignment.
