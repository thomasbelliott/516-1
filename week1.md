# Week 1 Homework Problems

1. How much information does a coss toin contain? a single dice roll?

2. Alice is telling Bob about the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. The speed of the network connection between Alice and Bob is 10 Mbps (megabits per second). How long will it take Alice to communicate this information to Bob over this network connection?

3. Eight teams are playing a soccer tournament using the single-elimination principle: They first play the quarter-final round; then in the semifinal round only four are left; then the two winners of the semifinals meet in the final round to determine the champion. In total, 4 quarter-final matches + 2 semifinal matches + 1 final match = 7 matches are held. Each match contributes one bit of information, so the total information of the tournament is 7 bits. On the other hand, since the tournament selects one champion out of eight teams, the information of the tournament should be log<sub>2</sub>(8) = 3 bits. Explain the inconsistency.

4. How much information is there in a three-letter English word?

5. Alice and Bob are playing the 20-question game. Alice thinks of a natural number from a predefined range, and Bob tries to guess it by asking Alice yes/no questions. What largest predefined range of possible numbers would guarantee that Bob will win the game (using the best-available strategy) regardless of which particular number from the range Alice thinks of?
